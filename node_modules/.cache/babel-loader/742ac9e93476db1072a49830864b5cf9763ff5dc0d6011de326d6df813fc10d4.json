Modern recycling facilities can handle both crushed and uncrushed cans.\r\nEmpty aerosol cans: Make sure to completely empty aerosol cans before placing them in the recycling bin.

Heavy contamination can disqualify the entire batch from recycling.\r\nWet or moldy paper: Paper that is excessively wet or moldy should not be recycled. This can deteriorate the entire batch and disrupt the recycling process.\r\nLocal guidelines: As mentioned earlier, consult your local waste collection provider's website for specific instructions on accepted paper types and any preparation requirements.\r\n        `,\r\n        recycled :`\r\n        While most clean paper products are recyclable, some exceptions exist:\r\n\r\n        Paper cups: These often have a plastic lining that makes them unsuitable for curbside recycling.

There are many different types of plastics, each with its own properties and recycling potential.`,\r\n        accepted : `Not all plastics are created equal, and what gets accepted in your curbside recycling program depends on your local facilities.  Generally, rigid plastics with recycling codes 1 and 2 (usually PET and HDPE) are widely accepted.

This code indicates the type of plastic and helps sorting facilities determine if it's accepted in your program.\r\nLeave lids on: Contrary to popular belief, some recycling programs now accept lids with plastic bottles. Check your local guidelines.\r\nDon't bag your recyclables: Plastic bags can tangle equipment at recycling facilities. Place loose plastic items directly in the recycling bin.\r\nRinse, but don't overdo it: A quick rinse to remove food or beverage residue is sufficient.\r\nWhen in doubt, throw it out: If you're unsure whether a plastic item is recyclable in your area, err on the side of caution and toss it in the trash.\r\n        `,\r\n        recycled :`\r\n        What gets recycled varies by location.  Your local municipality or waste disposal provider should have a recycling guide that details what materials are accepted in your curbside program.
