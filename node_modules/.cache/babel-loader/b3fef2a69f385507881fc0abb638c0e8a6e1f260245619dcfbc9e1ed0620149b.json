In fact, separating glass colors is important for the recycling process.  Brown glass is often used for beer bottles, wine bottles, and some food containers.\",\r\n        clean:`\r\n        Rinse the container: Simply remove any leftover food or beverage residue with a quick rinse. Don't use harsh soaps or detergents, as these can contaminate the recycling stream.\r\nRemove lids and labels: Most curbside programs require lids and labels to be removed before recycling. Check with your local provider for specific instructions.`,\r\n        instructions : `\r\n        Here are some things to keep in mind when recycling brown glass:\r\n\r\nLeave the cap off: Recycle glass containers without their lids or caps. These are usually made of different materials and should be recycled separately (check your local guidelines).\r\nDon't bag your glass: Place loose glass containers directly in your recycling bin. Bagging glass can contaminate the recycling stream and hinder the sorting process.\r\nCheck for cracks or breaks: Most programs accept broken glass as long as the pieces are large enough to handle safely. However, some might have specific requirements.\r\n        `,\r\n        recycled :`\r\n        Besides brown glass, many communities accept other colored glass for recycling, such as:\r\n\r\n        Clear glass: Often used for food containers, beverage bottles, and jars.\r\n        Green glass: Commonly used for wine bottles and some beverage containers.\r\n        `\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        title:\"CardBoard\",\r\n        Whatare: `Cardboard is a thick, stiff paperboard material commonly used for making boxes, packaging materials, and even some furniture components.

Here's what you should do:\r\n\r\nRemove any excess packaging materials: If your cardboard box has plastic strapping or packing tape, remove it before placing it in the recycling bin. These materials often need to be recycled separately.\r\nScrape off excessive food residue: For cardboard containers that held food, scrape off any large chunks or residue that could attract pests or contaminate the recycling stream.\r\nDon't worry about minor stains: A light oil stain or a few drops of liquid won't usually disqualify cardboard from recycling. Most programs can handle minimal contamination.\r\n        `,\r\n        recycled :`\r\n        Here are some key things to remember:\r\n\r\n        Flatten the cardboard: Break down cardboard boxes by flattening them. This saves space in your recycling bin and allows for more efficient processing at recycling facilities.\r\n        Cut up large pieces: If you have very large cardboard pieces, consider cutting them down to a manageable size that fits comfortably in your bin.\r\n        Check for local guidelines: While most programs accept cardboard, some might have specific requirements.
